          The LVFS is a free service that operates as an independent legal
          entity and has no connection with your distribution.
          Your distributor may not have verified any of the firmware files for
          compatibility with your system.
          All firmware is provided only by the original equipment manufacturer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enabling this functionality is done at your own risk, so please do not
          file issues with your distributor as they will not be able to help.
