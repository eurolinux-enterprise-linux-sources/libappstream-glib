    <h1>AppStream-Glib</h1>
    <p>
      This library provides GObjects and helper methods to make it easy to read and
      write AppStream metadata. It also provides a simple DOM implementation that
      makes it easy to edit nodes and convert to and from the standardized XML
      representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What this library allows you to do:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read and write compressed AppStream XML files</li>
      <li>Add and search for applications in an application store</li>
      <li>Get screenshot image data and release announcements</li>
      <li>Easily retrieve the best application data for the current locale</li>
      <li>Efficiently interface with more heavy-weight parsers like expat</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For more information about what AppStream is, please see the
      <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Distributions/AppStream/">wiki</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      To install the libappstream-glib library you either need to install the
      <code>libappstream-glib</code> package from your distributor, or you can build a local
      copy. To do the latter just do:
<pre>
dnf install automake autoconf libtool glib-devel
./autogen.sh
make
make install
</pre>

    <h2>More Information</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to actually generate metadata rather than just consuming it, you
      probably want to be looking at
      <a href="https://github.com/hughsie/createrepo_as">createrepo_as</a> or if
      you're completely lost, GNOME Software is a GUI tool that uses this library to
      implement a software center. See <code>src/plugins/gs-plugin-appstream.c</code> if you
      want some more examples on using this library where speed and latency really
      matter.
    </p>

    <h2>Hacking</h2>
    <p>
      If you want a new feature, or have found a bug or a way to crash this library,
      please report as much information as you can to the
      <a href="https://github.com/hughsie/appstream-glib/issues">issue tracker</a>
      - patches very welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      New functionality or crash fixes should include a test in `src/as-self-test.c`
      to ensure we don't regress in the future. New functionality should also be
      thread safe and also not leak *any* memory for success or failure cases.
    </p>
